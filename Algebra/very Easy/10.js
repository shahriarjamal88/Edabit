// Leap Year Function ⌚
// Write a function that returns true if a year is a leap, otherwise return false.

// A year is a "leap year" if it lasts 366 days, instead of 365 in a typical year. That extra day is added to the end of the shortest month, creating February 29.

// A leap year occurs every four years, and will take place if the year is a multiple of four. The exception to this is a year at the beginning of a century (for example, 1900 or 2000), where the year must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.

// Look at the examples, and if you need help, look at the resources panel.


function leapYear(year){
    if((year%4==0)&&(year%100 !=0)||(year%400==0)){
        return "ture"
    }
    else{
        return'flase'
    }
}
console.log(year(2020))
